# Personal-Website
This is my personal website repository. It contains all the code I use for my website.
I am currently updating it the more I learn about HTML/CSS/JS.
It is not complete and still requires a lot more work.
Upcoming additions include: Mobile Responsiveness, Improved Skills Section, and improved animations.
